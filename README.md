# ML_basics
This repository is used for showcasing my current knowledge in machine learning, as well as for learning purposes.

To replicate the code, I advise to create a conda environment as follows:

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Use the conda_env.yaml file to create the environment for this project (conda env create -f conda_env.yaml).
3. Install the [pytorch version](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) that suits your system.
